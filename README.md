# Docker_and_data_analysis
we will use Docker to analyze all the files in a directory.

We will build a docker to automatically login to a server and fetch the files present in some directory.
It will process those files to Display:

-Total number of text files in the directory and their names.
-Total number of words in text files (all files combined).
-Word (minimum length of word is 5) with highest and lowest frequency.
-Result should change if I change files on hadoop-gate-0 in your directory.
